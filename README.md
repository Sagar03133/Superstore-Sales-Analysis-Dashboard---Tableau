## Goal:
To build an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides deep insights into sales and profitability trends of a retail business. The aim is to identify high-performing products, spot underperforming segments, evaluate shipping effectiveness, and uncover geographic opportunities to help drive strategic business decisions.

## Problem Statement:
- The retail store is experiencing fluctuating profits across various product categories, regions, and shipping modes. Decision-makers need a centralized view of operations to:
- Identify which sub-categories are driving or dragging profits.
- Understand when sales peak during the year.
- Determine if the current shipping modes align with customer behavior and cost-efficiency.
- Find out which geographic regions are underperforming.

## Objective:
To solve the above business problems by transforming raw sales data into an insightful, interactive dashboard using Tableau that:
- Visualizes sales and profit trends over time.
- Highlights the most and least profitable sub-categories.
- Evaluates the effectiveness of shipping modes.
- Maps regional performance to guide location-specific strategies.

## Problem-Solving Approach:
Data Exploration & Cleaning
-Loaded the Superstore dataset into Tableau.
- Verified data types, cleaned null values, and ensured date formats were correct.
- KPI Identification
- Selected key performance indicators such as Total Sales, Profit, Average Discount, and Shipping Mode Contribution.
- Dashboard Components & Logic

Designed charts and graphs to answer key business questions:
- What are the best-selling and most profitable product categories?
- Which shipping method is most used and effective?
- How does profit vary over months and years?
- Which US states generate high vs. low profits?

## Analysis Performed:
1. Sub-Category Performance (Bar Chart)
Identified Phones, Chairs, and Storage as top contributors to profit.
Highlighted loss-making categories like Tables and Fasteners.

2. Order Trend Analysis (Line Chart)
Monthly/Quarterly trend shows sales spike in November and December.
Indicates effectiveness of year-end promotions or seasonal demand.

3. Ship Mode vs Sales (Pie Chart)
Standard Class accounts for ~59% of total sales.
Same Day shipping is least used (~5.6%), possibly due to higher costs.

4. Regional Performance (Heat Map)
Highest profit from California (₹4.57 Lakhs), followed by New York.
States in the central US like Texas, Iowa, and Arizona show relatively low or negative profit.

5. Month-wise Profit (Time Series Chart)
Displayed profit trends from 2013–2018.
Though monthly profit varies, an overall upward trend is observed using a trend line.
Seasonal dips and spikes reflect real-world retail cycles.

## Key Insights:
- Certain sub-categories significantly outperform others and may benefit from further investment.
- November and December are peak months; consider seasonal promotions.
- Standard shipping is the most cost-effective and preferred by customers.
- Central U.S. regions show lower profitability — potential for market strategy revision.
